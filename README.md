## Delivery Dashboard

#### Veiw project here: <a href="https://adam-86.github.io/delivery-dashboard/" target="_blank">Delivery Dashboard</a>

#### What is it?
One of many small ~~craft~~ code projects completed for the sole purpose of learning new things and to help prepare myself for some of the unique challenges I will undoubtedly face moving forward!

### Original Design
First and foremost, I did **not** design this. I discovered it on dribbble.com and replicated the static images with HTML,CSS, and javaScript.. You can view the original here: [Delivery Dashboard](https://dribbble.com/shots/3808674-Delivery-Dashboard-standalone/attachments/860067 "Delivery Dashboard")

### Cool Stuff
The "Daily Orders" pie chart presented a great oportunity to play around with SVG's, and the entire dashboard is 100% responsive!

#### Omissions, Deviations and not awesome stuff
I had to recreate all of the assets (icons, logos, etc.) in Photoshop and Illustrator so you may notice a few small differences, the right side bar is missing a quite a few details. The code organization and naming conventions are pretty gross and will be vastly improved moving forward.
